a pod can run multiple containers with different codebases, and these containers can be used for various purposes such as the main application, helper services, logging, or monitoring. However, in the context of Istio and the sidecar proxy, the sidecar proxy (Envoy) is agnostic to the specific codebase of the containers within the pod.

ðŸ”¹ Can a Pod Run Containers with Different Codebases?
Yes, a pod can run containers with different codebases. Kubernetes allows you to run multiple containers in a single pod, each with its own codebase, configuration, and purpose.

For example, you might have:

Service A running as one container (service-a-container), which contains the main application logic.
A helper container (service-a-helper-container) that could be used for tasks like logging, monitoring, or managing state.
This is a common use case when you want to colocate related containers that need to share the same storage, networking, and lifecycle.

ðŸ”¹ Sidecar Proxy in Pods with Different Codebases
In the context of Istio, the sidecar proxy (Envoy) does not depend on the specific codebase or the logic of the containers within the pod. The sidecar proxy manages network traffic for the entire pod, regardless of the codebases in the containers.

Even if the containers in the pod are running different codebases (for example, a front-end application and a back-end service), the sidecar will still manage all traffic to and from the containers, ensuring that traffic routing, security (e.g., mTLS), and monitoring policies are applied.

ðŸ”¹ Why the Same Sidecar Works for Different Containers in a Pod
Pod Level Network Isolation:
All containers in the pod share the same network namespace. This means that:

They can communicate with each other over localhost (127.0.0.1).
The sidecar proxy intercepts all network traffic for the pod, whether it's going to the application container or the helper container.
Unified Traffic Management:
The sidecar proxy is responsible for managing the traffic at the pod level, not at the individual container level. It handles:

Inbound traffic: The proxy intercepts all traffic directed to any container within the pod.
Outbound traffic: The proxy also manages any traffic that the containers send to other services, both internal and external.
Independent of Codebase:
The sidecar is independent of the application codebase. It works by intercepting traffic and applying networking, security, and observability policies. It doesnâ€™t matter whether the containers run different codebases. The sidecar handles network-level concerns for all containers in the pod.

ðŸ”¹ Example Scenario
Letâ€™s assume a pod with the following two containers:

Container 1: service-a-container (a web server or application service).
Container 2: helper-service-container (a logging or monitoring service).
Sidecar: istio-proxy (the Envoy proxy).
Both the service-a-container and the helper-service-container can be running different codebases, but the sidecar proxy will manage the traffic for both:

Inbound traffic (to the pod) will go through the Envoy sidecar.
The sidecar will forward the traffic to the appropriate container inside the pod.
Outbound traffic from either container will also go through the sidecar.
Traffic Flow Example:
Client Request (e.g., GET /products):

The client sends the request to the pod's public IP or service.
The sidecar proxy intercepts the request.
The proxy checks the requestâ€™s routing rules (defined in VirtualService), and forwards the request to container 1 (service-a-container).
Helper Service:

If container 2 (helper-service-container) needs to communicate with an external service or a different pod, the request will be routed through the sidecar proxy as well.
ðŸ”¹ Different Types of Services in the Same Pod:
One Sidecar per Pod:
No matter how many different types of services (or different codebases) you have inside the pod, there is still only one sidecar proxy per pod. The sidecar handles all the traffic management for the pod, and this is agnostic to the containers' codebases.

Shared Sidecar:
In cases where a pod contains multiple containers with different services, all traffic from those services is handled by the same sidecar proxy. This includes traffic to other services in the mesh or external services.
