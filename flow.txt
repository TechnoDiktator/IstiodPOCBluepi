New Flow Works Without Code-Based Authentication

1Ô∏è‚É£ User logs in via Auth0 and gets a JWT token.
2Ô∏è‚É£ User sends request to Service A with the JWT token.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Istio checks the JWT before allowing traffic to Service A.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Service A calls Service C (JWT is forwarded).
5Ô∏è‚É£ Istio verifies JWT before allowing traffic to Service C.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Service C calls Service B (JWT is forwarded).
7Ô∏è‚É£ Istio verifies JWT before allowing traffic to Service B.
8Ô∏è‚É£ Service B processes the request and returns data.


‚úîÔ∏è Removes the need for JWT validation in application code.
‚úîÔ∏è Istio ensures only valid JWT tokens reach your services.
‚úîÔ∏è Centralized authentication & authorization across all services.
‚úîÔ∏è No changes required when switching identity providers (e.g., Auth0 ‚Üí Okta).
‚úîÔ∏è Less boilerplate in your Go services (focus only on business logic).

üöÄ Now, your services are fully secured using Istio without any JWT validation in the code! Let me





// OLD FLOW

Setup has three services (Service A, Service B, and Service C), secured using Auth0 for user authentication and Istio for service-to-service authentication.

1Ô∏è‚É£ A user logs in and gets a JWT token from Auth0.
2Ô∏è‚É£ The user sends a request to Service A, including the JWT token in the Authorization header.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Service A validates the JWT token using Auth0 (inside the Go code).
4Ô∏è‚É£ Service A forwards the request to Service C, including the JWT token.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Istio mTLS ensures that only Service A can talk to Service C (service-to-service authentication).
6Ô∏è‚É£ Service C validates the JWT token using Auth0 (inside the Go code).
7Ô∏è‚É£ Service C forwards the request to Service B, including the JWT token.
8Ô∏è‚É£ Istio mTLS ensures that only Service C can talk to Service B.
9Ô∏è‚É£ Service B validates the JWT token using Auth0 (inside the Go code).
üîü Service B responds to Service C ‚Üí Service A ‚Üí Client.

Step-by-Step Flow
1Ô∏è‚É£ Client Requests a JWT Token from Auth0
    The user logs in to Auth0 using OAuth.
    Auth0 generates a JWT token and returns it to the client.
    The client includes the JWT token in the Authorization header for every request.

JWT EXAMPLE
{
  "alg": "RS256",
  "typ": "JWT",
  "kid": "some-key-id"
}
{
  "iss": "https://dev-s8pk7mul3yw2xy77.us.auth0.com/",
  "sub": "auth0|user123",
  "exp": 1700000000
}







2Ô∏è‚É£ Client Calls Service A (API Gateway)
üìå Request to Service A:

http
Copy
Edit
GET /products
Host: service-a.example.com
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>

Service A is exposed through an Istio Ingress Gateway.
Istio allows external traffic via a VirtualService.
Service A validates the JWT token using Auth0‚Äôs JWKS keys.
‚úÖ If the JWT is valid, Service A forwards the request to Service C.
‚ùå If the JWT is invalid, Service A returns 401 Unauthorized.







3Ô∏è‚É£ Service A Calls Service C
üìå Internal Request (Service A ‚Üí Service C)

http
Copy
Edit
GET /products
Host: service-c.default.svc.cluster.local
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
Istio mTLS enforces authentication between Service A and Service C.
Service A forwards the JWT token to Service C.
Service C validates the JWT using Auth0.
‚úÖ If JWT is valid & Istio allows traffic, request continues.
‚ùå If JWT is invalid, Service C returns 401 Unauthorized.







4Ô∏è‚É£ Service C Calls Service B
üìå Internal Request (Service C ‚Üí Service B)

http
Copy
Edit
GET /products
Host: service-b.default.svc.cluster.local
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
Istio mTLS enforces authentication between Service C and Service B.
Service C forwards the JWT token to Service B.
Service B validates the JWT using Auth0.
Service B queries MySQL for product data.
‚úÖ If JWT is valid & Istio allows traffic, Service B fetches data from MySQL and responds.
‚ùå If JWT is invalid, Service B returns 401 Unauthorized.









5Ô∏è‚É£ Service B Returns Data to Service C ‚Üí Service A ‚Üí Client
üìå Response from Service B to Service C

json
Copy
Edit
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Laptop",
    "price": 1000
  }
]
Service C receives the response and forwards it to Service A.
Service A sends the final response to the client.
üìå Final Response to Client

{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Laptop",
      "price": 1000
    }
  ],
  "serviceA_metadata": "request processed at 2025-02-12T08:00:00Z"
}
‚úÖ The client successfully receives the product list!
