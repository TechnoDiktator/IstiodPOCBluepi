Setup has three services (Service A, Service B, and Service C), secured using Auth0 for user authentication and Istio for service-to-service authentication.

1️⃣ A user logs in and gets a JWT token from Auth0.
2️⃣ The user sends a request to Service A, including the JWT token in the Authorization header.
3️⃣ Service A validates the JWT token using Auth0 (inside the Go code).
4️⃣ Service A forwards the request to Service C, including the JWT token.
5️⃣ Istio mTLS ensures that only Service A can talk to Service C (service-to-service authentication).
6️⃣ Service C validates the JWT token using Auth0 (inside the Go code).
7️⃣ Service C forwards the request to Service B, including the JWT token.
8️⃣ Istio mTLS ensures that only Service C can talk to Service B.
9️⃣ Service B validates the JWT token using Auth0 (inside the Go code).
🔟 Service B responds to Service C → Service A → Client.

Step-by-Step Flow
1️⃣ Client Requests a JWT Token from Auth0
    The user logs in to Auth0 using OAuth.
    Auth0 generates a JWT token and returns it to the client.
    The client includes the JWT token in the Authorization header for every request.

JWT EXAMPLE
{
  "alg": "RS256",
  "typ": "JWT",
  "kid": "some-key-id"
}
{
  "iss": "https://dev-s8pk7mul3yw2xy77.us.auth0.com/",
  "sub": "auth0|user123",
  "exp": 1700000000
}







2️⃣ Client Calls Service A (API Gateway)
📌 Request to Service A:

http
Copy
Edit
GET /products
Host: service-a.example.com
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>

Service A is exposed through an Istio Ingress Gateway.
Istio allows external traffic via a VirtualService.
Service A validates the JWT token using Auth0’s JWKS keys.
✅ If the JWT is valid, Service A forwards the request to Service C.
❌ If the JWT is invalid, Service A returns 401 Unauthorized.







3️⃣ Service A Calls Service C
📌 Internal Request (Service A → Service C)

http
Copy
Edit
GET /products
Host: service-c.default.svc.cluster.local
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
Istio mTLS enforces authentication between Service A and Service C.
Service A forwards the JWT token to Service C.
Service C validates the JWT using Auth0.
✅ If JWT is valid & Istio allows traffic, request continues.
❌ If JWT is invalid, Service C returns 401 Unauthorized.







4️⃣ Service C Calls Service B
📌 Internal Request (Service C → Service B)

http
Copy
Edit
GET /products
Host: service-b.default.svc.cluster.local
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
Istio mTLS enforces authentication between Service C and Service B.
Service C forwards the JWT token to Service B.
Service B validates the JWT using Auth0.
Service B queries MySQL for product data.
✅ If JWT is valid & Istio allows traffic, Service B fetches data from MySQL and responds.
❌ If JWT is invalid, Service B returns 401 Unauthorized.









5️⃣ Service B Returns Data to Service C → Service A → Client
📌 Response from Service B to Service C

json
Copy
Edit
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Laptop",
    "price": 1000
  }
]
Service C receives the response and forwards it to Service A.
Service A sends the final response to the client.
📌 Final Response to Client

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Laptop",
      "price": 1000
    }
  ],
  "serviceA_metadata": "request processed at 2025-02-12T08:00:00Z"
}
✅ The client successfully receives the product list!
